# Crypto exchange script

### Description

Like good technology visionaries, your company has decided to create its own
cryptocurrency exchange, called XTF (eXtortion, Travesty, Fraud). The exchange
allows its clients to deposit funds in the form of cryptocurrencies and fiat
currencies; exchange their funds for other currencies; custody of funds and
lending of funds (called margin).

In order for users to keep track of their accounts (and the funds in them), your
exchange must keep a record of the transactions made by all users. However, your
accounting is very cluttered and messy (as it should be for any good startup),
and so all records are mixed up with each other and stored in one or more text,
or compressed, files. However, through the GUI, you should only show each user
records from their business account. As part of the pre-processing of the data
for output, you will need to filter and sort the user records.

However, if you really want to succeed in the field of cryptocurrency fintech
companies, you need to grow faster and more than your competitors. In order to
lure as many new users as possible to your exchange, you have promised them
fabulous appreciation of their deposited funds through your sister investment
company. Since financial regulations are for backward-looking people and not for
visionaries of your cut, there is nothing stopping you from showing users
fictitious profits on their investments.

Although you are otherwise principally concerned with using the latest and most
advanced technologies (the right buzzwords will ensure an influx of additional
capital from investors), in this particular case it actually makes more sense to
solve the problem using a shell script rather than a trained neural network.

### Usage

```sh
xtf [-h|--help] [FILTER] [COMMAND] USER LOG [LOG2 [...]
```

Options

- `COMMAND` can be one of:
  - `list` - a listing of records for the given user.
  - `list-currency` - listing a sorted list of occurring currencies.
  - `status` - a listing of the actual account status grouped and sorted by
    currency.
  - `profit` - a statement of the customer's account status with notional profit
    included.

- `FILTER` can be a combination of the following:
  - `-a DATETIME` - after: only records AFTER this date and time (without it)
    are considered. DATETIME is of format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
  - `-b DATETIME` - before: only records BEFORE this date and time (without it)
    are considered.
  - `-c CURRENCY` - only records corresponding to the given currency are
    considered.

- `-h` and `--help` print a help message with a short description of each
  command and switch.

### Specification

1. The script filters, groups and dumps logs from cryptocurrency exchange logs.
   If a command is given to the script, it executes the command over the
   filtered records.
2. If the script is to dump a list or account status, each entry is dumped on
   one line and only once. The order of the lines is given alphabetically by
   currency code. Items must not be repeated. The output format for the account
   status for each currency is `CODE : VALUE`.
3. `list` describes the (filtered) records corresponding to the `USER` on the
   standard output in the order in which they appear in the input log files.
4. `list-currency` lists the currency codes occurring in the `USER`'s (filtered)
   records. The currency codes are sorted alphabetically.
5. `status` calculates and prints the account status for each currency of the
   `USER` based on the (filtered) records. The list of currencies and their
   balances is sorted alphabetically by currency code. In this case, do not
   include notional investment returns in the results.
6. `profit` is similar to the `status`, except that positive currency balances
   are artificially inflated by `x`%, where `x` is the value of the environment
   variable `XTF_PROFIT`. However, you are a bit forgetful and so sometimes
   forget to set the variable. If the `XTF_PROFIT` environment variable is not
   set, consider the default value of 20% (too high an appreciation could
   attract unwanted attention from regulators). The value of the `XTF_PROFIT`
   variable will always be a non-negative integer.

### Details

1. If the script receives no command input, consider the default command `list`.
2. The script can also process logs compressed using the `gzip` tool (if the log
   file name ends in `.gz`). Obviously, without compression it would be
   difficult to store large amounts of data on your servers.
3. Assume that input files cannot have names corresponding to a command, switch,
   or currency code.
4. Assume that the value of the input parameter `USER` does not match the value
   of any command, switch, or currency code.
5. If the `-h` or `--help` switch is specified, it will always just print a hint
   and exit the script (that is, if the switch is followed by any command or
   file, it will not execute).
