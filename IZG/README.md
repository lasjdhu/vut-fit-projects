# Shaders

### Description

Your task is to implement a simple graphics card (GPU) and a function to render
models. In the file `gpu.cpp` implement the function `izg_enqueue` - the
functionality of the graphics card you have implemented. In the
`prepareModel.cpp` file, implement the `prepareModel`, `drawModel_vertexShader`,
and `drawModel_fragmentShader` functions. These functions are used to process
the loaded model file into the graphics card memory and command buffer. In
addition, there is a `fwd.hpp` file - it contains declarations of structures and
constants.

### Usage

Files `gpu.cpp` and `prepareModel.cpp` are the only files I modified. Whole
project was wrapped in a template made by Ph.D Tomáš Milet and it is too big for
this repository, so the project you see here cannot be compiled :)
